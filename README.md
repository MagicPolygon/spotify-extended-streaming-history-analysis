# spotify-extended-streaming-history-analysis
A personal project that uses my personal Spotify data to discover more about my listening habits and tastes. Raw data includes a list of songs listened to, with details on when a stream ended, how long it played, and if it was skipped. Data cleaned and transformed using Python, and visualisations produced using Tableau.
