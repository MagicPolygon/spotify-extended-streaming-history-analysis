# spotify-extended-streaming-history-analysis
A personal project that uses my personal Spotify data to discover more about my listening habits and tastes. The raw data includes a list of songs listened to, with details on when a stream ended, how long it played, and if it was skipped. The data is prepared using Python, and visualisations will be produced using Tableau.
